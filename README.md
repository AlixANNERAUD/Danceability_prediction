# 💃 Music danceability prediction

## 🚀 Introduction

As part of our introductory data science course, we worked on a project to apply the concepts covered in class.

We began with [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ektanegi/spotifydata-19212020) containing information on 160,000 songs released between 1921 and 2020, with each year featuring the top 100 most listened-to songs. This data was extracted from the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).

Our model does not rely on a genuine assessment of danceability but rather on [calculations made by Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features). It is likely biased because its aim is to closely align with what has been computed by Spotify.

For our project, we used Python with Jupyter Notebook for coding and LaTeX for the report.
